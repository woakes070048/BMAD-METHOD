  ## RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
  
  ### Assessment Framework
  **Standard**: [ISO 31000 / COSO ERM / NIST / Custom]
  **Scope**: [Project/Department/Enterprise/Specific Process]
  **Time Horizon**: [Assessment period]
  **Perspective**: [Strategic/Operational/Financial/Compliance]
  
  ### Risk Scoring Matrix
  ```
  PROBABILITY SCALE (1-5):
  1 = Rare (< 5% chance)
  2 = Unlikely (5-25% chance)
  3 = Possible (25-50% chance)
  4 = Likely (50-75% chance)
  5 = Almost Certain (> 75% chance)
  
  IMPACT SCALE (1-5):
  1 = Negligible (< $10K impact)
  2 = Minor ($10K - $100K impact)
  3 = Moderate ($100K - $1M impact)
  4 = Major ($1M - $10M impact)
  5 = Catastrophic (> $10M impact)
  
  RISK SCORE = Probability × Impact
  RISK LEVEL:
  - Critical: 20-25 (Red)
  - High: 15-19 (Orange)
  - Medium: 8-14 (Yellow)
  - Low: 1-7 (Green)
  ```
