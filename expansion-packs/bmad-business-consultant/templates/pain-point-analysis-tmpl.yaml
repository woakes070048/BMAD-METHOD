  ## Methodology Overview
  
  ### Pain Point Analysis Framework
  - **COUNT**: Number of mentions across all data sources
  - **URGENCY**: Time-sensitivity of the problem (High/Medium/Low)
  - **IMPACT**: Severity of consequences if unresolved (High/Medium/Low)
  - **PRIORITY SCORE**: COUNT Ã— (URGENCY + IMPACT)
  
  ### Scoring Criteria
  **Urgency Levels**:
  - **High (3)**: Immediate action required, time-critical
  - **Medium (2)**: Important but not immediately critical
  - **Low (1)**: Can be addressed over time
  
  **Impact Levels**:
  - **High (3)**: Severe consequences, business-critical
  - **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact on operations/satisfaction
  - **Low (1)**: Minor inconvenience or limitation
