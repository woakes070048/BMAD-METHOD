## Lean Manufacturing Principles and Implementation

### Core Lean Principles

**The Five Principles of Lean:**
1. **Value Definition**: Precisely specify value from the customer's perspective
2. **Value Stream Mapping**: Identify all activities in the value stream for each product family
3. **Flow Creation**: Make value-creating steps flow smoothly without interruption
4. **Pull System**: Let customers pull value from upstream activities
5. **Perfection Pursuit**: Continuously improve toward perfection

**Eight Types of Waste (Muda):**
1. **Overproduction**: Producing more than customer demand or earlier than needed
2. **Waiting**: Delays due to process bottlenecks, equipment downtime, or resource unavailability
3. **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement of materials or products
4. **Overprocessing**: Performing work that adds no value or doing more than required
5. **Inventory**: Excess raw materials, work-in-process, or finished goods
6. **Motion**: Inefficient movement of people or equipment
7. **Defects**: Products or services that don't meet specifications
8. **Underutilized Talent**: Not fully utilizing people's skills, knowledge, and creativity
