# Create Porter's Five Forces Analysis Task

## Task Description
Create a comprehensive Porter's Five Forces analysis for an industry using professional business consulting methodology to assess competitive dynamics and industry attractiveness.

## Input Parameters
- **industry**: Industry or market to analyze (required)
- **geographic_scope**: Regional focus (global, national, regional, local)
- **timeframe**: Current state, historical trends, or future outlook
- **competitive_focus**: Specific competitive dynamics to emphasize

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Industry Research and Definition
1. Define industry boundaries and scope clearly
2. Gather comprehensive industry data and trends
3. Identify key players and market structure
4. Research industry value chain and economics

### Step 2: Apply Porter's Five Forces Framework
Use this professional consulting prompt structure:

```
Act as a Business Consultant from a top management company. 
I want you to generate a Porter's Five Forces Analysis on the {industry} using only current information.

The {industry} is "{user_provided_industry}"

Layout the Porter's Five Forces Analysis in the following format. 
Give reasons why each point is included and assess its impact on industry competitiveness. 
Make the analysis compelling and professional, prioritizing the most significant forces.

Start the analysis with a paragraph showing the introduction and definition of the {industry}.
End the analysis with a conclusion about overall industry attractiveness and competitive intensity.

Each force will use the "bullet, bold, description format" shown here:

* **competitive factor**: explanation of how this factor affects industry competition and profitability

# {industry} - Porter's Five Forces Analysis

[introduction and definition about the {industry}]
 
## 1. Competitive Rivalry (Competition in the Industry)
[list factors about competitive rivalry - use bullet, bold, description format - maximum of 4] 
 
## 2. Threat of New Entrants (Potential for New Entrants)
[list factors about barriers to entry and new entrant threats - use bullet, bold, description format - maximum of 4] 
 
## 3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
[list factors about supplier power and influence - use bullet, bold, description format - maximum of 4]
 
## 4. Bargaining Power of Buyers
[list factors about customer power and influence - use bullet, bold, description format - maximum of 4]
 
## 5. Threat of Substitute Products or Services
[list factors about substitute threats and alternatives - use bullet, bold, description format - maximum of 4]
 
## Industry Attractiveness Assessment

[conclusion about overall industry attractiveness, competitive intensity, and strategic implications]
```

### Step 3: Five Forces Analysis Guidelines

**Competitive Rivalry**:
- Number and strength of competitors
- Industry growth rate and market maturity
- Product differentiation and switching costs
- Exit barriers and industry capacity
- Strategic stakes and competitive moves

**Threat of New Entrants**:
- Capital requirements and investment needs
- Economies of scale and experience curves
- Brand loyalty and customer switching costs
- Access to distribution channels
- Government regulations and legal barriers
- Retaliation by existing competitors

**Bargaining Power of Suppliers**:
- Supplier concentration and market structure
- Uniqueness and importance of supplier products
- Switching costs to alternative suppliers
- Forward integration potential of suppliers
- Availability of substitute inputs

**Bargaining Power of Buyers**:
- Buyer concentration and purchase volumes
- Importance of product to buyer's business
- Switching costs and alternative options
- Backward integration potential of buyers
- Price sensitivity and profit margins

**Threat of Substitutes**:
- Availability of alternative solutions
- Relative price and performance of substitutes
- Switching costs to substitute products
- Buyer propensity to substitute
- Technology trends enabling substitution

### Step 4: Force Assessment and Integration
1. Evaluate the strength of each force (weak, moderate, strong)
2. Assess interactions between different forces
3. Identify which forces are most critical for industry profitability
4. Consider how forces may change over time
5. Determine overall industry attractiveness

### Step 5: Strategic Implications
1. Assess overall competitive intensity and industry profitability
2. Identify key success factors for competing in the industry
3. Highlight strategic opportunities and threats
4. Consider positioning strategies for different force configurations
5. Evaluate industry evolution and future scenarios
