# Create Business Model Canvas Task

## Task Description
Create a comprehensive Business Model Canvas for a product, service, or company using the proven 9-building-block framework with professional business consulting methodology.

## Input Parameters
- **target**: Product, service, or company to analyze (required)
- **stage**: Business stage (startup, growth, mature, transformation)
- **focus**: Specific focus area (new product launch, business model innovation, strategic planning)

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Research and Background Analysis
1. Gather comprehensive information about the target business
2. Understand the market context and competitive landscape
3. Research customer segments and value propositions
4. Analyze current business model (if existing)

### Step 2: Apply Business Model Canvas Framework
Use this professional consulting prompt structure:

```
Act as a Business Consultant from a top management company. 
I want you to generate a Business Model Canvas on {target} using only current information. 

The {target} is "{user_provided_target}"

Make the Business Model Canvas compelling and professional and sort the lists with the most important factors first.

Start the analysis with a paragraph showing the introduction and definition of the {target}.  
If this is a company traded on the stock market, include stock ticker in the introduction.

End the analysis with a strategic conclusion about the business model strengths and potential areas for improvement.

Each building block will use the "bullet, bold, description format" shown here:

* **key element**: explanation of why this element is important and how it creates value

Layout the Business Model Canvas in markdown format:
