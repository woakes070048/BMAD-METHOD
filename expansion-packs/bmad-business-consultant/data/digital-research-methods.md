### COUNT/URGENCY/IMPACT Scoring System

#### COUNT Methodology
- **Raw Frequency**: Number of mentions across all sources
- **Platform Weighting**: Adjust for platform relevance and quality
- **Temporal Trends**: Recent vs. historical mention patterns
- **Source Diversity**: Breadth of customer types mentioning the problem

#### URGENCY Assessment
**High (3)**: Immediate action required, time-critical impact
- Language: "urgent", "ASAP", "immediately", "can't wait"
- Context: Business-critical operations, customer-facing issues

**Medium (2)**: Important but manageable timeline
- Language: "soon", "next quarter", "when possible"
- Context: Process improvements, efficiency gains

**Low (1)**: Long-term consideration, not time-sensitive
- Language: "eventually", "nice to have", "future consideration"
- Context: Enhancement features, optimization opportunities

#### IMPACT Evaluation
**High (3)**: Severe consequences, business-critical effects
- Business impact: Revenue loss, customer churn, operational failure
- Personal impact: Job security, career advancement, reputation

**Medium (2)**: Moderate impact on operations or satisfaction
- Business impact: Efficiency reduction, moderate cost increase
- Personal impact: Stress increase, workflow disruption
