# Cognitive Biases in Business Analysis Knowledge Base

## Overview
Understanding cognitive biases is crucial for accurate root cause analysis, decision-making, and problem-solving. This knowledge base documents common biases that affect business analysis and how to mitigate them.

## 1. Decision-Making Biases
