- All testing must pass before production deployment authorization

### 5.2 Risk-Critical Dependencies

**High-Risk Dependencies:**
1. **External System Access**: Delays in accessing Airtable/n8n systems
2. **Stakeholder Approval**: Architecture and design approval cycles
3. **Data Quality Issues**: Unexpected data quality problems requiring cleanup
4. **Integration Complexity**: Complex integration requirements extending development

### 5.3 Optimization Opportunities

**Parallel Work Streams:**
- Airtable analysis can run parallel with n8n analysis
- DocType development can start before complete analysis finish
- Training material development can run parallel with testing
- Documentation can be prepared during development phases
