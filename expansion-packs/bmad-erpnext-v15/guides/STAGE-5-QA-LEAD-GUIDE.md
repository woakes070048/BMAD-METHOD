| Severity | Open | Fixed | Closed | Total |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Critical | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| High | 1 | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| Medium | 2 | 5 | 3 | 10 |
| Low | 3 | 4 | 2 | 9 |

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Payment integration pending testing
- **Medium Risk**: Performance under load not fully tested
- **Low Risk**: Minor UI issues on older browsers

### Recommendations
1. Fix remaining high-priority defects
2. Complete payment integration testing
3. Perform load testing before production
4. Schedule UAT for next week

### Sign-off Criteria Status
- [x] All critical test cases executed
- [x] No critical defects open
- [x] Pass rate > 95%
- [ ] UAT completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

**Sample Automated Test:**
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

class TestCustomerPortal:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("https://erp.example.com")
        
    def test_customer_login(self):
        # Login
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_email").send_keys("customer@example.com")
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_password").send_keys("password")
        self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_button").click()
        
        # Wait for dashboard
        wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10)
        dashboard = wait.until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "dashboard"))
        )
        
        assert dashboard is not None
        
    def test_view_orders(self):
        self.test_customer_login()
        
        # Navigate to orders
        self.driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "My Orders").click()
        
        # Wait for order list
        wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10)
        orders = wait.until(
            EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "order-card"))
        )
        
        assert len(orders) > 0
        
    def teardown_method(self):
        self.driver.quit()
```

## Best Practices

### DO's:
- ✅ Test early and often
- ✅ Automate repetitive tests
- ✅ Test in production-like environment
- ✅ Include negative test cases
- ✅ Document test results thoroughly
- ✅ Collaborate with developers
- ✅ Focus on user experience

### DON'Ts:
- ❌ Skip test planning
- ❌ Test only happy path
- ❌ Ignore non-functional requirements
- ❌ Delay defect reporting
- ❌ Test with production data
- ❌ Assume requirements are complete
- ❌ Skip regression testing

## Common Testing Challenges

### Challenge 1: Incomplete Requirements
**Problem**: Requirements not detailed enough
**Solution**: Work with BA to clarify, document assumptions

### Challenge 2: Environment Issues
**Problem**: Test environment unstable
**Solution**: Dedicated test instance, automated provisioning

### Challenge 3: Test Data Management
**Problem**: Maintaining consistent test data
**Solution**: Automated test data generation, data refresh scripts

### Challenge 4: Time Constraints
**Problem**: Not enough time for thorough testing
**Solution**: Risk-based testing, automation, parallel execution

## 🎯 Complete Workflow Example

### Example: Testing Story 1.1 - User Registration

```bash
# Step 1: Receive completed feature from developers
# Review development completion: user-registration-feature/

# Step 2: Create comprehensive test plan
/bmadErpNext:agent:erpnext-qa-lead
*create-test-plan user-registration-story
# Follow prompts to create test plan covering:
# - Functional testing of registration flow
# - Security testing of authentication
# - Performance testing of registration process
# - Integration testing with customer portal

# Step 3: Setup test environment
*setup-test-environment
# Prepares test environment with:
# - Clean ERPNext instance
# - Test data sets
# - Browser automation setup

# Step 4: Execute test suite
*run-functional-tests      # Test registration workflow
*run-security-tests       # Test authentication security
*run-integration-tests    # Test with existing systems
*run-performance-tests    # Test response times

# Step 5: Validate acceptance criteria
*validate-acceptance user-registration-story
# Checks each acceptance criteria:
# ✓ User can register with email
# ✓ Email verification works
# ✓ Registration creates customer record
# ✓ Portal access is granted

# Step 6: Report any defects found
*report-defects
# Document any issues found:
# - Bug descriptions
# - Steps to reproduce
# - Screenshots/evidence
# - Severity levels

# Step 7: Verify bug fixes (if any)
*validate-fixes
# Re-test fixed issues

# Step 8: Generate final test report
*generate-test-report
*prepare-uat
# Prepare for user acceptance testing

# Step 9: Final approval
*approve-release          # Give QA sign-off
*exit
```
