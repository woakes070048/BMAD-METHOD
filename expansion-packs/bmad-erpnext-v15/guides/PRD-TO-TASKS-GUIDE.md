# PRD to Task Lists: Complete Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to transform a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into actionable task lists using the BMAD-ERPNext method. This hierarchical breakdown ensures complex projects are manageable, trackable, and can be distributed effectively across development teams.

## Process Hierarchy

```
PRD (Product Requirements Document)
├── Epic 1 (Major Feature Set)
│   ├── Story 1.1 (User Feature)
│   │   ├── Task 1: DocType Creation
│   │   ├── Task 2: Business Logic
│   │   ├── Task 3: Frontend Development
│   │   └── Task 4: Testing
│   ├── Story 1.2 (Integration Feature)
│   │   └── [Tasks...]
│   └── Story 1.3 (Enhancement)
│       └── [Tasks...]
└── Epic 2 (Another Feature Set)
    └── [Stories and Tasks...]
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Create the PRD

The PRD is your top-level document that defines the entire product or feature set.

**PRD Components:**
- **Goals and Context**: Business objectives and background
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
- **DocType Specifications**: Data models and relationships
- **Integration Requirements**: External systems and APIs
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes

**Template Location**: `/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-erpnext-v15/templates/erpnext-prd-template.yaml`

### Step 2: Break PRD into Epics

Epics are major features or capabilities that deliver significant business value.

**Epic Characteristics:**
- Self-contained but contribute to overall vision
- Typically contain 1-5 stories
- Can be delivered independently
- Have clear business value proposition

**Epic Components:**
- Epic statement (As a... I want... So that...)
- Business value description
- Scope definition (in/out of scope)
- Story list with dependencies
- Acceptance criteria
- Timeline and effort estimates

**Template Location**: `/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-erpnext-v15/templates/erpnext-epic-template.yaml`

### Step 3: Decompose Epics into Stories

Stories are user-centric features that can be completed in 1-3 days.

**Story Format:**
```
As a [user type] using ERPNext,
I want [specific capability],
So that [business benefit]
```

**Story Components:**
- User story statement
- Acceptance criteria (numbered list)
- Tasks/Subtasks breakdown
- Technical context and specifications
- Testing requirements
- Dependencies on other stories

**Story Numbering**: `{epic_num}.{story_num}` (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)

**Template Location**: `/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-erpnext-v15/templates/erpnext-story-template.yaml`

### Step 4: Break Stories into Tasks

Tasks are specific, actionable development activities.

**Task Categories:**

#### DocType Tasks
- Create/modify DocType schema
- Configure field types and validations
- Set up relationships and permissions
- Define naming conventions

#### Controller Tasks
- Implement business logic
- Add validation hooks
- Configure workflow integration
- Handle events and triggers

#### Frontend Tasks
- Create Vue.js components
- Implement Frappe UI patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Add accessibility features

#### API Tasks
- Create whitelisted endpoints
- Implement authentication
- Add input validation
- Define response formats

#### Integration Tasks
- Configure docflow workflows
- Set up n8n_integration hooks
- Test multi-app compatibility
- Implement data synchronization

#### Testing Tasks
- Write unit tests
- Create integration tests
- Test mobile UI functionality
- Validate acceptance criteria

#### Deployment Tasks
- Create migration scripts
- Document bench commands
- Prepare deployment procedures
- Update configuration files

**By Layer**
- Business layer (processes, requirements)
- Application layer (ERPNext configuration)
- Data layer (database design)
- Integration layer (external systems)

**By Lifecycle**
- Planning documentation
- Implementation guides
- Deployment procedures

## Practical Example

### PRD: "Customer Self-Service Portal"

```yaml
Goal: Enable customers to manage their account online
```

### Epic 1: "Order Management"

```yaml
Epic Statement: 
  As a customer,
  I want to manage my orders online,
  So that I can track purchases without calling support

Stories:
  - 1.1: View Order History
  - 1.2: Track Order Status
  - 1.3: Download Invoices
```

### Story 1.1: "View Order History"

```yaml
Story:
  As a customer,
  I want to view my past orders,
  So that I can reference previous purchases

Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Customer can see list of all past orders
  2. Orders display date, total, and status
  3. Orders are paginated (20 per page)
  4. Customer can search orders by date range
  5. Mobile responsive design
```

### Tasks for Story 1.1

```yaml
DocType Tasks:
  - [ ] Create CustomerPortalSettings DocType
  - [ ] Add portal_access field to Customer DocType
  - [ ] Configure permissions for portal users

Controller Tasks:
  - [ ] Implement get_customer_orders() method
  - [ ] Add order filtering logic
  - [ ] Create pagination controller
  - [ ] Add security validation

Frontend Tasks:

## Key Templates Reference

| Template | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| PRD Template | Define product requirements | `/templates/erpnext-prd-template.yaml` |
| Epic Template | Define major features | `/templates/erpnext-epic-template.yaml` |
| Story Template | Define user stories | `/templates/erpnext-story-template.yaml` |
| Task Lists | Break down development work | Within story documents |

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Everyone understands the relationship between requirements and tasks
2. **Manageable Chunks**: Complex projects become manageable through decomposition
3. **Parallel Development**: Multiple team members can work on different stories/tasks
4. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into project status at all levels
5. **Documentation**: Built-in documentation throughout the process
6. **Flexibility**: Can adjust stories and tasks without affecting entire project
7. **Quality Assurance**: Each level has acceptance criteria and validation

## Tips for Success

1. **Start High-Level**: Don't get into implementation details in the PRD
2. **Keep Stories Small**: If a story takes more than 3 days, break it down further
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Document which stories depend on others
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Make them specific and testable
5. **Regular Reviews**: Review and update documents as project evolves
6. **Team Involvement**: Include developers in story breakdown for better estimates
7. **Version Control**: Track all document changes in git

## Conclusion

The PRD to Task List process provides a structured approach to breaking down complex ERPNext development projects. By following this hierarchical decomposition, teams can effectively manage large-scale implementations while maintaining clarity, accountability, and quality throughout the development lifecycle.

For specific ERPNext implementations, always consider:
- Frappe Framework constraints and patterns
- Multi-app integration requirements
- Mobile-first design principles
- Security and permission requirements
- Performance and scalability needs

This methodology ensures that nothing is overlooked and that all team members understand their responsibilities within the larger project context.
