## Using the Expansion Pack

### üåê Web UI Usage (Gemini Gem, CustomGPT)

#### Step 1: Prepare Agent Files

```bash
# Navigate to the expansion pack
cd expansion-packs/bmad-erpnext-v15

# Agents are in the agents/ directory
ls agents/
# Shows: erpnext-architect.yaml, api-developer.yaml, etc.
```

#### Step 2: Create Your AI Agent

1. **For Gemini Gem**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
   - Create a new Gem
   - Upload agent files from `agents/` directory
   - Set system instructions

2. **For CustomGPT**:
   - Go to ChatGPT
   - Create a new GPT
   - Upload agent files
   - Configure instructions

#### Step 3: Agent Instructions Template

```
You are an expert ERPNext v15 development team member.
Your operating instructions are defined in the attached files.
Do not break character as directed.

Available commands:
*help - Show available commands
*agent [name] - Switch to specific agent
*workflow [name] - Start a workflow
*team [name] - Activate an agent team

You specialize in:
- ERPNext v15 architecture and development
- Frappe Framework best practices
- Vue 3 and modern frontend development
- Business process automation

nano config.yaml
```

#### Key Configuration Sections

```yaml
# ERPNext Environment Settings
environment:
  bench_path: "/home/frappe/frappe-bench"  # Your bench path
  primary_site: "your-site.com"            # Your ERPNext site
  user: "frappe"                           # System user
  development_directory: "/path/to/dev"    # Development directory

# Existing Apps Integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cannot find BMAD-METHOD"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory
ls expansion-packs/bmad-erpnext-v15/
# Should show: agents/, workflows/, templates/, etc.
```

#### Issue: "Agent not loading in Web UI"
**Solution**:
- Ensure you uploaded the correct `.yaml` files from `agents/`
- Check that system instructions reference BMAD-METHOD
- Verify the agent file syntax is valid YAML

#### Issue: "ERPNext commands not working"
**Solution**:
```bash
# The agents provide ERPNext expertise and generate code
# You still need an actual ERPNext installation to run the code

# Check ERPNext is installed:
bench version

# If not installed, the agents can guide installation:
*agent erpnext-architect
"Guide me through ERPNext installation"
```

#### Issue: "Workflow not starting"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Workflows coordinate multiple agents
# Ensure you have the required context:

*workflow modern-app-development
# Provide project requirements when prompted
```
