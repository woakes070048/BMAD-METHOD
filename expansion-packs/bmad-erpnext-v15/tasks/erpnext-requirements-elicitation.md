```

### Step 2: Business Process Analysis

#### Current State Documentation
```python

    "process_name": "Sales Order Processing",
    "steps": [
        {
            "step": 1,
            "description": "Customer inquiry received",
            "current_system": "Email/Phone",
            "time_taken": "30 minutes",
            "pain_points": ["No tracking", "Lost inquiries"]
        },
        {
            "step": 2,
            "description": "Quotation preparation",
            "current_system": "Excel template",
            "time_taken": "2 hours",

        {
            "decision": "Approve discount > 10%",
            "current_process": "Email approval",
            "stakeholders": ["Sales Manager", "Finance Head"]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### ERPNext Mapping Analysis
```yaml
erpnext_mapping:
  lead_management:
    current_state: "Excel spreadsheet tracking"
    erpnext_solution: "Lead DocType with automated nurturing"
    modules_involved: ["CRM"]
    customizations_needed: 
      - "Lead scoring algorithm"
      - "Custom follow-up templates"
    
  quotation_process:
    current_state: "Manual Word/Excel documents"
    erpnext_solution: "Quotation DocType with item catalog"
    modules_involved: ["Selling", "Stock"]
    integrations_needed:
      - "Product catalog sync"
      - "Pricing rules engine"
```

### Step 3: Functional Requirements Gathering

#### Use Case Development
```markdown
## Use Case Template

**Use Case ID**: UC-001
**Use Case Name**: Create Customer Quotation
**Actor**: Sales Executive
**ERPNext Module**: Selling

### Preconditions
- Customer Lead exists in system
- Product catalog is updated
- User has Selling permissions

### Main Flow
1. User searches for customer in Lead/Customer list
2. System displays customer history and preferences
3. User creates new Quotation
4. System auto-populates customer details
5. User adds items from product catalog
6. System calculates pricing based on rules
7. User applies discounts (if authorized)
8. System generates quotation PDF
9. User sends quotation to customer
10. System tracks quotation status

### Alternative Flows
- A1: Customer not found → Create new customer
- A2: Discount requires approval → Route to manager
- A3: Product not in catalog → Request product addition

### Exception Flows
- E1: Pricing rules conflict → Display error and suggest resolution
- E2: User lacks permissions → Redirect to request access

### Business Rules
- Discounts > 10% require manager approval
- Quotations valid for 30 days
- Auto-convert to Sales Order if accepted within 48 hours
