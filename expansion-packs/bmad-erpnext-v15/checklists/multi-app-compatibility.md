# Multi-App Compatibility Checklist

## Pre-Development Checks
- [ ] Verify docflow app version and API compatibility
- [ ] Check n8n_integration webhook endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Confirm no DocType name conflicts between apps
- [ ] Validate database table namespace separation

## Development Phase Checks
- [ ] Test new DocTypes don't interfere with docflow workflows
- [ ] Verify API endpoints don't conflict with existing routes
- [ ] Check webhook triggers work with n8n_integration
- [ ] Validate permission inheritance works correctly

## Integration Testing
- [ ] Create test workflow that spans multiple apps
- [ ] Test data flow between your app and docflow
- [ ] Verify n8n_integration triggers fire correctly
- [ ] Check error handling doesn't break existing functionality

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure impact on existing app performance
- [ ] Test database query performance with additional tables
- [ ] Verify memory usage doesn't increase significantly
- [ ] Check that background jobs don't interfere

## Deployment Checks
- [ ] Backup database before deploying new app
- [ ] Test migration scripts with existing data
- [ ] Verify all apps start correctly after deployment
- [ ] Check log files for any conflict errors

## Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Test existing docflow workflows still function
- [ ] Verify n8n_integration webhooks still trigger
- [ ] Check user permissions work across all apps
- [ ] Monitor system performance for 24 hours

## Rollback Procedure
- [ ] Document steps to uninstall new app if needed
- [ ] Prepare database rollback scripts
- [ ] Have backup restoration procedure ready
- [ ] Test rollback process in development environment
