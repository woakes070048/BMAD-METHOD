workflows:
  project_setup:
    steps:
      - "Analyze project requirements and target platforms"
      - "Choose appropriate architecture pattern (desktop-first vs mobile-first)"
      - "Set up Vue 3 project with Vite build configuration"
      - "Configure Frappe UI and component library integration"
      - "Implement base layout components and navigation patterns"
      - "Set up state management with Pinia stores"
      - "Configure router and implement navigation guards"
      - "Set up responsive design system and breakpoints"
      
  component_development:
    steps:
      - "Design component hierarchy and props interface"
      - "Implement base component using Frappe UI patterns"
      - "Add responsive behavior and mobile adaptations"
      - "Implement state management and data binding"
      - "Add validation and error handling"
      - "Write component documentation and usage examples"
      - "Test component across different screen sizes"

  performance_optimization:
    steps:
      - "Analyze bundle size and identify optimization opportunities"
      - "Implement code splitting and lazy loading"
      - "Optimize component rendering with computed properties"
      - "Add virtual scrolling for large data sets"
      - "Configure service worker and caching strategies"
      - "Implement resource preloading and prefetching"

patterns:
  desktop_layout: |
    Classic sidebar navigation with main content area.
    Fixed sidebar on desktop, collapsible drawer on mobile.
    Header bar with user menu and global actions.
    
  mobile_layout: |
    Bottom tab navigation with ion-router-outlet.
    Full-screen content with floating action buttons.
    Pull-to-refresh and swipe gestures support.
    
  responsive_forms: |
    Single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop.
    Touch-friendly input sizes and spacing.
    Contextual validation and error display.
    
  data_display: |
    Card-based layouts that adapt to screen size.
    List views with swipe actions on mobile.
    Table views with horizontal scrolling fallback.

best_practices:
  - "Always start with mobile-first responsive design principles"
  - "Use Frappe UI components consistently for design system coherence"
  - "Implement proper loading states and error boundaries"
  - "Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns for better code reuse"
  - "Use TypeScript for better development experience and type safety"
  - "Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)"
  - "Optimize for performance with lazy loading and code splitting"
  - "Test thoroughly across different devices and screen sizes"

code_standards:
  - "Use single-file components (.vue) with script setup syntax"
  - "Implement consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables)"
  - "Use computed properties for derived state, avoid watchers when possible"
  - "Implement proper prop validation and default values"
  - "Use emits for parent-child communication, avoid direct prop mutations"
  - "Follow Vue style guide recommendations for component structure"
  - "Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, avoid custom CSS when possible"

integration_points:
  erpnext_backend:
    - "Use createResource for all API communications"
    - "Implement proper error handling for server responses"
    - "Handle authentication state and session management"
    - "Integrate with ERPNext DocTypes and permissions system"
    
  frappe_framework:
    - "Use frappe.client methods for CRUD operations"
    - "Implement proper file upload and attachment handling"
    - "Integrate with Frappe's translation system"
    - "Use Frappe's print format and report integration"

testing_approach:
  - "Unit tests for individual components and composables"
  - "Integration tests for store actions and API calls"
  - "E2E tests for critical user workflows"
  - "Visual regression tests for UI consistency"
  - "Performance tests for bundle size and runtime metrics"

deployment_considerations:

  - "CDN configuration for static assets"
  - "Browser compatibility testing and polyfill requirements"
  - "Progressive Web App configuration and service worker setup"
  - "SEO optimization for single-page applications"
