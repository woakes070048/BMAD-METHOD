# DocFlow and Server Manager Integration Guide
## BMAD ERPNext v16 Expansion Pack

This document outlines how the BMAD ERPNext v16 expansion pack integrates with and supports existing DocFlow and Server Manager applications in your ERPNext environment.

---

## üìã Overview

The expansion pack is designed to work seamlessly with existing ERPNext apps including DocFlow (workflow management) and Server Manager. It includes specific integration points, validation systems, and safety protocols to prevent structural issues while maximizing compatibility.

## üîÑ DocFlow Integration

### What is DocFlow?

DocFlow is a comprehensive document flow management system for ERPNext that enables:
- Multi-stage document approval workflows
- Automated document routing and state management
- Role-based task assignments with intelligent workload balancing
- Parallel and sequential flow processing
- Integration with existing ERPNext DocTypes

### Integration Points

#### 1. **Workflow Specialist Agent Integration**
The expansion pack includes a dedicated `workflow-specialist` agent (Zane Donovan) who is specifically trained in DocFlow patterns:

```yaml
Agent: workflow-specialist
Expertise:
  - ERPNext native workflows
  - DocFlow integration patterns
  - State transitions and validation
  - Email notifications and alerts
  - Webhook configurations
Tasks:
  - create-workflow.md
  - integrate-docflow.md
```

#### 2. **DocFlow Task (integrate-docflow.md)**
Complete task definition for integrating DocFlow functionality:
- Document flow architecture design
- Flow template creation (sales, purchase, approval, QA processes)
- Intelligent user assignment with workload balancing
- Automatic stage execution
- Dashboard and monitoring interfaces

Key Features Documented:
- **Document Flow DocType**: Complete schema with stages, links, and conditions
- **Flow Controller Logic**: Python implementation with validation and state management
- **Template System**: Pre-built templates for common business processes
- **Event Hooks**: Integration with ERPNext document lifecycle events
- **Dashboard Components**: Vue.js components for flow monitoring
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test cases for flow validation

#### 3. **Agent Awareness**
Multiple agents are aware of DocFlow and consider it in their operations:

- **bench-operator**: Manages DocFlow app deployment and updates
- **testing-specialist**: Performs compatibility testing with DocFlow
- **doctype-designer**: Considers DocFlow workflow stages when designing DocTypes
- **erpnext-qa-lead**: Validates multi-app integration including DocFlow
- **erpnext-product-owner**: Considers DocFlow in product decisions

#### 4. **Configuration Support**
The `config.yaml` includes DocFlow configuration templates:

```yaml
integration:
  existing_systems:
    docflow:
      description: "Workflow management system"
      integration_points:
        - "Use docflow for complex approval processes"
        - "Leverage existing workflow templates"
        - "Maintain compatibility with docflow APIs"
      considerations:
        - "Check docflow version compatibility"
        - "Test workflow triggers"
        - "Validate data flow between systems"
```

### DocFlow Best Practices (from expansion pack)

1. **Flow Design Principles**
   - Keep flows simple and intuitive
   - Design for common business processes
   - Allow flexibility and customization
   - Consider parallel processing where appropriate
   - Plan for exception handling and recovery

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Index flow-related fields properly
   - Use background jobs for heavy processing
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor flow execution times
   - Clean up completed flows periodically

3. **Security and Permissions**
   - Implement proper role-based access control
   - Validate user permissions at each stage
   - Audit flow actions and decisions
   - Secure sensitive data in flow stages
   - Implement approval limits and escalation

4. **Intelligent Assignment Logic**
   - Workload-based user assignment
   - User availability checking (last login, enabled status)
   - Round-robin with workload balancing
   - Role-specific preferences support
   - Automatic escalation for overdue tasks

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Manager Integration

### What is Server Manager?

While Server Manager is referenced in the expansion pack as an app that had structural issues (similar to DocFlow's past challenges), the expansion pack includes comprehensive validation systems to prevent these issues.

### Prevention Systems

#### 1. **Eva Thorne Validation System**
The expansion pack recently added the Eva Thorne (app-structure-validator) agent specifically to prevent DocFlow/Server Manager structural issues:

```yaml
Agent: app-structure-validator (Eva Thorne)
Purpose: Prevent structural issues like those in DocFlow/Server Manager
Capabilities:
  - Import structure validation
  - File organization compliance
  - Naming convention enforcement
  - Dependency analysis
  - Anti-pattern detection
```

#### 2. **Structure Validation Checklist**
Comprehensive checklist to prevent issues:
- Agent-driven structure validation checklist
- App structure compliance checklist
- Code change preflight checklist
- Multi-app compatibility checks

#### 3. **Enforcement Tasks**
- `validate-app-structure.md`: Comprehensive validation to prevent structural issues
- `enforce-structure-compliance-with-agents.md`: Agent-driven enforcement system

### Lessons Learned Applied

The expansion pack incorporates lessons from DocFlow (123+ import violations) and Server Manager issues:

1. **Mandatory Safety Protocols**
   - Universal context detection workflow
   - Change justification requirements
   - Three-strike failure rule
   - Panic mode detection

2. **Structure Standards**
   - Proper import patterns
   - File organization rules
   - Naming conventions
   - Dependency management

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Pre-commit validation
   - Import structure checking
   - Anti-pattern detection
   - Compliance monitoring

## üîß Working with Both Apps

### Multi-App Environment Management

The expansion pack is configured to work in environments with multiple apps:

```yaml
installed_apps:
  - frappe
  - erpnext
  - docflow
  - server_manager  # If present
  - n8n_integration
  - [your_custom_apps]
```

### Agent Coordination

When working with DocFlow and Server Manager:

1. **Use the workflow-specialist agent** for DocFlow-related tasks
2. **Use the app-structure-validator agent** to prevent structural issues
3. **Use the bench-operator agent** for app management and deployment
4. **Use the testing-specialist agent** for compatibility testing

### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Validate existing app structure
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator
"Validate DocFlow and Server Manager app structures"

# 2. Create new workflow integration
/bmadErpNext:agent:workflow-specialist
"Create purchase approval workflow integrated with DocFlow"

# 3. Test multi-app compatibility
/bmadErpNext:agent:testing-specialist
"Test compatibility between DocFlow, Server Manager, and new features"

# 4. Deploy with safety checks
/bmadErpNext:agent:bench-operator
"Deploy changes with DocFlow and Server Manager compatibility checks"
```

## üìä Integration Patterns

### DocFlow Integration Patterns

1. **Document Lifecycle Integration**
```python
# Hook into DocFlow from your custom app
def on_document_submit(doc, method):
    if has_docflow_workflow(doc.doctype):
        create_docflow_instance(doc)
```

2. **Approval Process Integration**
```python
# Use DocFlow for complex approvals
flow = create_approval_flow(
    document=doc,
    approval_matrix=get_approval_matrix(doc),
    escalation_rules=get_escalation_rules()
)
```

3. **State Management**
```python
# Sync document state with DocFlow
def sync_with_docflow(doc):
    flow = get_active_flow(doc)
    if flow:
        doc.workflow_state = flow.current_stage
```

### Validation Patterns

1. **Pre-Change Validation**
```python
# Always validate before changes
validator = AppStructureValidator()
issues = validator.validate_app_structure("docflow")
if issues:
    handle_validation_failures(issues)
```

2. **Import Structure Checking**
```python
# Check import patterns
from app_validator import check_imports
issues = check_imports("server_manager")
enforce_import_standards(issues)
```
