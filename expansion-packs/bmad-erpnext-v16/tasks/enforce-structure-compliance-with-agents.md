# Task: Enforce Structure Compliance with AI Agents
## Preventing DocFlow/Server Manager Issues Through Agent-Driven Enforcement

**Primary Agent**: Eva Thorne (App Structure Validator)  
**Task Type**: Enforcement & Prevention  
**Priority**: Critical - Mandatory for all new apps  
**Integration**: BMAD ERPNext v16 Expansion Pack  
**Success Criteria**: Zero apps deployed with compliance <85%  

---

## üéØ TASK OVERVIEW

This task establishes a comprehensive agent-driven enforcement system that prevents structural issues like those experienced with DocFlow (123+ import violations) and Server Manager apps. The system integrates seamlessly with developer workflows while maintaining rigorous compliance standards.

### Problem Statement
- **DocFlow**: Business logic incorrectly placed in business modules causing 123+ import violations
- **Server Manager**: Similar structural anti-patterns violating Frappe Framework standards
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proactive structure validation during development lifecycle

### Solution Approach
- **AI Agent-Driven Validation**: Eva Thorne provides real-time structure guidance
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Supporting agents ensure comprehensive validation
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with BMAD expansion pack system
- **Prevention Focus**: Stop issues before they occur, not fix them afterward

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Agent-Driven Pre-Development Enforcement

#### Step 1: Mandatory Structure Planning (30 minutes)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Before any coding begins
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

# Required prompt structure:
"Eva, I need to create a new Frappe app called '[app_name]' with these features:
- [Feature 1: Description]
- [Feature 2: Description]
- [Feature N: Description]

Requirements:
1. Analyze Frappe CRM structure at /home/frappe/crm/crm
2. Create compliant structure template 
3. Define import patterns to prevent DocFlow violations
4. Ensure ‚â•95% compliance score
5. Document anti-patterns to avoid"
```

**Expected Output**:
- Detailed structure template with proper directory organization
- Import pattern documentation
- Compliance score assessment
- Anti-pattern warnings
- Production-ready structure plan

#### Step 2: Multi-Agent Template Validation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Coordinate with supporting agents
/bmadErpNext:agent:main-dev-coordinator

"Claudia, coordinate template validation for [app_name] with:
- Eva Thorne (structure compliance)
- Allison Blake (Frappe standards)
- Team lead approval
Require ‚â•95% compliance before development approval."
```

**Enforcement Criteria**:
- [ ] Eva Thorne compliance score ‚â•95%
- [ ] Allison Blake Frappe compliance approval
- [ ] Team lead sign-off on structure template
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] **NO CODING ALLOWED** until all criteria met

#### Step 3: Baseline Establishment (10 minutes)
```bash
# Document approved template as baseline
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, document this approved template as the compliance baseline for [app_name]:
[paste approved template]

Set up monitoring for:
- Daily compliance checks
- Import pattern validation
- Structural drift detection
- Real-time violation alerts"
```

### Phase 2: Development-Time Enforcement

#### Daily Compliance Monitoring (2 minutes/day - MANDATORY)
```bash
# REQUIRED: Daily structure validation
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, perform mandatory daily compliance check for [app_name]:
1. Compare current structure to approved baseline
2. Validate any new imports against patterns
3. Check for DocFlow-style violations
4. Report compliance score changes
5. Flag any structural drift
6. Provide immediate fix recommendations for violations"
```

**Enforcement Actions**:
- **Green (‚â•95%)**: Continue development
- **Yellow (85-94%)**: Warning issued, fixes required within 24 hours
- **Orange (70-84%)**: Development slowed, immediate remediation required
- **Red (<70%)**: **STOP development**, emergency protocol activated

#### Real-Time Import Validation (On every import change)
```bash
# Triggered automatically or manually when imports added
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, validate these new imports in [app_name]:
[paste import statements]

Check for:
1. DocFlow anti-patterns (business logic in business modules)
2. Correct import path compliance
3. Circular dependency risks
4. Module vs business module placement
5. Impact on compliance score"
```

**Automatic Enforcement**:
- Git pre-commit hooks validate imports
- CI/CD pipeline blocks non-compliant commits
- Real-time IDE integration (future enhancement)
- Automated alerts to development team

#### Weekly Team Compliance Review (30 minutes - MANDATORY)
```bash
# Weekly team coordination
/bmadErpNext:agent:main-dev-coordinator

"Claudia, coordinate weekly compliance review for all active apps:
1. Eva Thorne comprehensive audit
2. Compliance trend analysis  
3. Team training needs assessment
4. Process improvement recommendations
5. Stakeholder reporting"
```

### Phase 3: Pre-Deployment Enforcement

#### Comprehensive Final Audit (45 minutes - MANDATORY)
```bash
# REQUIRED: Before any deployment
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, perform comprehensive final deployment audit for [app_name]:

CRITICAL VALIDATION:
1. Complete structure compliance analysis (‚â•95% required)
2. All import patterns validated against standards
3. Zero DocFlow-style anti-patterns confirmed
4. Hooks.py configuration compliance verified
5. Module organization matches Frappe CRM standards
6. Production deployment certification or REJECTION
7. Risk assessment for deployment
8. Post-deployment monitoring plan"
```

**Deployment Gate Enforcement**:
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Eva Thorne compliance score <95%
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Any critical violations detected
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Import pattern violations present
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Anti-patterns found in structure
- [ ] **REQUIRED**: Multi-agent validation pipeline completed

#### Multi-Agent Deployment Pipeline (60 minutes)
```yaml
deployment_pipeline:
  stage_1_structure:
    agent: eva-thorne
    timeout: 15_minutes
    criteria: "‚â•95% compliance, zero anti-patterns"
    blocker: true
    
  stage_2_compliance:
    agent: allison-blake (frappe-compliance-validator)
    timeout: 15_minutes
    criteria: "Frappe-first principles validated"
    blocker: true
    
  stage_3_integration:
    agent: nathan-stark (data-integration-expert)
    timeout: 15_minutes
    criteria: "Multi-app compatibility verified"
    blocker: true
    
  stage_4_qa:
    agent: steve-jinks (testing-specialist)
    timeout: 15_minutes
    criteria: "Quality gates passed, testing complete"
    blocker: true
    
  stage_5_coordination:
    agent: claudia-donovan (main-dev-coordinator)
    timeout: 10_minutes
    criteria: "Final approval and deployment coordination"
    blocker: true
```

            const validation = this.callEvaThorne(document);
            
            if (validation.compliance < 85) {
                this.showError("Eva Thorne: Structure violation detected");
                this.preventSave();
            }
        }
    }
    
    callEvaThorne(document) {
        // Integration with BMAD expansion pack
        return bmadExpansion.agents.evaThorne.validate(document);
    }
}
```

#### Command Line Enforcement Tools

This enforcement framework transforms structure validation from a reactive process to a proactive, agent-driven system that prevents issues like DocFlow's structural problems before they can impact development productivity or code quality. The focus is on making compliance feel natural and beneficial rather than burdensome, while maintaining rigorous standards that ensure long-term maintainability and team productivity.
