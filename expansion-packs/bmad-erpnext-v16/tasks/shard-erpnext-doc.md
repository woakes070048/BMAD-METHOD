    purpose: "Content format categorization"
    
  by_implementation_phase:
    tags: ["planning", "development", "testing", "deployment", "maintenance"]
    purpose: "Project lifecycle organization"
```

### Step 4: Cross-Reference and Linking Strategy

#### Documentation Interconnection
```yaml
linking_strategy:
  centralized_index:

  bidirectional_references:
    business_to_technical:
      - "Business requirement → Technical implementation"
      - "Process step → Configuration procedure"
      - "Business rule → System constraint"
      
    technical_to_business:
      - "API endpoint → Business use case"
      - "Database table → Business entity"
      - "Configuration → Process impact"
      
  contextual_navigation:

    task_completion_rate: "User success rate following documentation"
    time_to_find_information: "Average search and discovery time"
    user_satisfaction_score: "Post-use satisfaction survey"
    
  maintenance_measures:
    content_freshness: "Time since last update"
    broken_link_frequency: "Rate of invalid cross-references"

## Best Practices

### Scalable Documentation Architecture
- **Modular design**: Create self-contained documentation modules
- **Consistent structure**: Use standardized templates and organization
- **Clear ownership**: Assign specific ownership for each documentation area
- **Regular maintenance**: Establish routine review and update cycles

### Effective Content Management
- **Single source of truth**: Avoid content duplication across repositories
- **Progressive disclosure**: Layer information from general to specific
- **Context-aware linking**: Provide relevant cross-references
- **User-centric organization**: Structure content around user needs

### Collaboration and Workflow
- **Distributed authoring**: Enable multiple contributors while maintaining quality
- **Efficient review processes**: Streamline review cycles without sacrificing quality
- **Change management**: Control and track documentation changes
- **Feedback integration**: Incorporate user feedback into improvement cycles
