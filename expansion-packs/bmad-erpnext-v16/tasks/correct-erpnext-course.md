# correct-erpnext-course

Identify and correct course deviations in ERPNext development projects, ensuring alignment with Frappe Framework best practices and project objectives.

## Purpose

When ERPNext development projects show signs of deviation from planned approach, technical debt accumulation, or framework compliance issues, this task provides a structured approach to identify problems and implement corrections.

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**
- ERPNext stories consistently fail validation
- Frappe Framework anti-patterns are emerging
- Multi-app integration issues are recurring
- Technical debt is accumulating rapidly
- Development velocity is decreasing significantly
- Quality standards are not being met
- Team coordination issues are affecting ERPNext development

## Course Correction Process

### 1. Current State Assessment

**1.1 ERPNext Development Health Check:**
```yaml
health_assessment:
  story_success_rate: [percentage of stories completing successfully]
  frappe_compliance: [adherence to Frappe-first principles]
  integration_stability: [multi-app integration success rate]
  code_quality_trends: [quality metrics over time]
  team_velocity: [story completion rate]
  technical_debt: [accumulation rate and severity]
```

**1.2 Framework Compliance Audit:**
- Review recent code for Frappe anti-patterns
- Assess API security and whitelisting compliance
- Validate DocType design patterns
- Check Vue.js integration quality
- Evaluate mobile-first implementation

**1.3 Integration Issues Analysis:**
- docflow integration problems
- n8n_integration automation issues
- Existing app compatibility problems
- Data flow and synchronization issues

### 2. Problem Identification

**2.1 Technical Issues:**
- Frappe Framework violations
- Performance bottlenecks in ERPNext code
- Security vulnerabilities or gaps
- Integration failures or conflicts
- Mobile responsiveness problems
- PWA implementation issues

**2.2 Process Issues:**
- Story definition quality problems
- Validation process gaps
- Development workflow inefficiencies
- Team communication breakdowns
- Quality assurance failures

**2.3 Resource Issues:**
- Skill gaps in ERPNext development

- Tool or environment limitations
- Knowledge sharing inadequacies

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

**3.1 Technical Root Causes:**
- Inadequate understanding of Frappe Framework
- Insufficient DocType design planning
- Poor Vue.js integration architecture
- Inadequate testing strategies
- Improper use of Frappe APIs

**3.2 Process Root Causes:**
- Incomplete story requirements
- Insufficient technical validation
- Weak coordination between specialists
- Inadequate quality gates
- Poor feedback loops

**3.3 Knowledge Root Causes:**
- Gap in Frappe Framework expertise
- Insufficient ERPNext domain knowledge
- Limited multi-app integration experience
- Inadequate mobile development skills
- Missing security best practices knowledge

### 4. Correction Strategy Development

**4.1 Technical Corrections:**

**Framework Compliance:**
```yaml
framework_corrections:
  - enforce_frappe_first: [eliminate external dependencies]
  - api_security_review: [implement proper whitelisting]
  - doctype_redesign: [fix relationship and field issues]
  - frontend_refactor: [proper Vue.js and Frappe UI usage]
  - performance_optimization: [database and query improvements]
```

**Integration Fixes:**
```yaml
integration_corrections:
  - docflow_alignment: [fix workflow integration issues]
