- **Zero Trust**: Verify and validate all access requests
- **Security by Design**: Build security into all systems from the start
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor and log all security-relevant events
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems and software updated

### ERPNext-Specific Considerations
- **Framework Security**: Leverage Frappe framework's built-in security features
- **Custom Development**: Follow secure coding practices for customizations
- **Data Sensitivity**: Protect sensitive business and personal data appropriately
- **Integration Security**: Secure all integrations with external systems
- **User Education**: Train users on security best practices and policies

### Continuous Improvement
- **Regular Assessment**: Conduct regular security assessments and reviews
