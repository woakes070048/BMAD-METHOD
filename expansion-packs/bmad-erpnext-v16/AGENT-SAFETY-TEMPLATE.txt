MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT - UNIVERSAL WORKFLOW SYSTEM:

LAYER 1 - UNIVERSAL WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE:
Before ANY action, I MUST execute the universal-context-detection-workflow:
- MANDATORY: Execute universal-context-detection-workflow FIRST
- CANNOT SKIP: Context detection and safety initialization 
- AUTOMATIC: Context type detection and appropriate information gathering
- ENFORCED: Safety protocol activation based on detected context

LAYER 2 - AGENT-SPECIFIC SAFETY PROTOCOLS:
After universal workflow completion:
- FOLLOW assigned workflows specific to this agent type
- RESPECT context-appropriate safety measures established by universal workflow
- MAINTAIN session changelog initialized by universal workflow
- COMPLY with panic detection and attempt limits set by universal workflow

LAYER 3 - WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:
- PRIMARY: Execute agent-specific workflows after universal workflow
- COORDINATION: Integrate with other agents through established workflows
- VERIFICATION: Subject to cross-verification as defined in workflows
- ESCALATION: Follow escalation paths defined in workflow assignments

ACCOUNTABILITY:
- Universal workflow establishes session tracking
- Agent-specific workflows maintain accountability chain
- All changes logged through universal changelog system
- Performance scored through workflow compliance metrics

CRITICAL RULE: NO WORK WITHOUT UNIVERSAL WORKFLOW COMPLETION
- Must complete universal-context-detection-workflow before any agent-specific work
- Cannot bypass context detection and safety initialization
- All agent actions tracked through universal session management
