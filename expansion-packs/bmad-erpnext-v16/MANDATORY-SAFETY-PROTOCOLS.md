# MANDATORY SAFETY PROTOCOLS
## System-Wide Enforcement for ERPNext v16 Expansion Pack

**STATUS**: ACTIVE AND ENFORCED
**APPLIES TO**: ALL agents, tasks, and workflows in bmad-erpnext-v16
**VIOLATIONS**: Result in immediate work stoppage and context gathering

---

## üö® UNIVERSAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### Rule #1: NO ACTION WITHOUT CONTEXT-ADAPTIVE GATHERING
Every agent MUST determine context type and gather appropriate information:
```yaml
context_type_detection:
  TROUBLESHOOTING:
    indicators: ["Active errors", "broken functionality", "system issues"]
    gather: ["pwd && git status", "tail -20 ../logs/frappe.log", "recent error analysis"]
  
  NEW_DEVELOPMENT:
    indicators: ["Planning phase", "creating from scratch", "requirements gathering"]
    gather: ["pwd && git status", "requirements analysis", "constraint identification"]
  
  ENHANCEMENT:
    indicators: ["Modifying working code", "adding features", "improving existing"]
    gather: ["pwd && git status", "git diff", "existing code analysis", "impact assessment"]
  
  MIGRATION:
    indicators: ["Converting systems", "data transformation", "workflow migration"]
    gather: ["pwd && git status", "source system analysis", "target system mapping"]

mandatory_for_all_contexts:
  - Document context type in SESSION-CHANGELOG.md
  - Verify capability appropriate to context
  - Check tools and rollback plan
```

### Rule #2: NO CHANGES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
Every action MUST include context-appropriate analysis:
```yaml
context_specific_requirements:
  TROUBLESHOOTING:
    required: ["Problem statement (not symptom)", "Root cause analysis", "Why this specific fix", "What could break", "How to rollback"]
  
  NEW_DEVELOPMENT:
    required: ["Clear requirements", "Business justification", "Technical approach", "Success criteria", "Alternative solutions considered"]
  
  ENHANCEMENT:
    required: ["Current state analysis", "Desired improvement", "Impact assessment", "Backwards compatibility", "Testing strategy"]
  
  MIGRATION:
    required: ["Source system analysis", "Target system requirements", "Data mapping strategy", "Migration risks", "Validation plan"]

universal_requirements:
  - Document reasoning in SESSION-CHANGELOG.md
  - Verify understanding before proceeding
  - Identify potential issues upfront
```

### Rule #3: STOP AT THIRD FAILURE
After 3 failed attempts:
```yaml
mandatory_stop:
  - HALT all changes
  - Document what was tried
  - Analyze why each failed
  - Gather missing context
  - Change approach completely
```

---

## üìã AGENT CUSTOMIZATION OVERRIDE

### For ALL Agent Files
Add to EVERY agent's customization field:

```yaml
customization: |
  MANDATORY PROTOCOLS:
  1. CONTEXT FIRST: Before ANY action, I MUST gather and document current context including working directory, active app, exact error, and recent changes
  2. ROOT CAUSE REQUIRED: I CANNOT make code changes without identifying and documenting the root cause, not just symptoms
  3. CHANGE JUSTIFICATION: Every modification MUST include: what, why, impact, alternatives, and rollback plan
  4. STOP AT THREE: After 3 failed attempts, I MUST stop, document learnings, and reassess approach
  5. ONE CHANGE RULE: Make ONE change, test it, verify it, THEN proceed to next
  6. NO PANIC MODE: If I'm making rapid changes without understanding, I MUST stop immediately
  Reference: MANDATORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md for full requirements
```

---

## üõë PANIC MODE DETECTION

### Automatic Triggers
Agents MUST self-detect panic mode when:
- Making 3+ changes without testing between
- Changing files without reading them first
- Using words like "try", "maybe", "hopefully"
- Can't explain why last change didn't work
- Adding try/catch without understanding error
- Modifying unrelated code "just in case"

### Required Response
```python
# When panic mode detected:
"""
‚ö†Ô∏è PANIC MODE DETECTED - STOPPING
1. Reverting to last known good state
2. Documenting what was attempted
3. Gathering missing context
4. Restarting with root cause analysis
"""
```

## üéØ TASK FILE UPDATES

### Required Header for ALL Task Files

```yaml
safety_requirements:
  context_gathering: mandatory
  root_cause_analysis: required
  change_justification: required
  panic_mode_detection: enabled
  max_attempts: 3
  
pre_execution_checklist:
  - [ ] Context gathered and documented

  - [ ] Success criteria defined
  - [ ] Rollback plan ready
```

---

## üö¶ QUALITY GATES - MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT

### Quality Gate System Integration
**NEW REQUIREMENT**: All agents MUST execute quality gates at defined checkpoints:
- **Definition**: quality-gates-definition.yaml
- **Enforcement**: quality-gate-enforcement-workflow.yaml
- **Checklist**: quality-gate-checklist.md
- **Testing**: testing-execution-workflow.yaml

### Before Code Changes - Pre-Development Gates
```bash
# MUST PASS ALL

‚úì Structure requirements reviewed (ERPNEXT-APP-STRUCTURE-PATTERNS.md)
‚úì Dependencies analyzed (analyze-app-dependencies task)
‚úì Test strategy defined
‚úì Can explain the problem
‚úì Can explain why it's happening
‚úì Can explain how fix addresses cause
‚úì Have tested hypothesis
‚úì Have rollback plan
```

### During Development - Active Gates
```bash
# CONTINUOUS VALIDATION
‚úì Import patterns validated (no forbidden imports)
‚úì Frappe-first compliance (no external libraries)
‚úì Incremental testing (tests written and passing)
‚úì Structure adherence (files in correct locations)
```

### Before Handoff - Quality Gate Enforcement
```bash
# MANDATORY BEFORE ANY HANDOFF
‚úì Execute quality-gate-enforcement-workflow
‚úì Structure validation by Eva Thorne
‚úì Test execution by testing-specialist
‚úì Documentation updated
‚úì All gates passed
```

### After Code Changes - Post-Development Gates
```bash
# MUST VERIFY ALL

‚úì Documentation complete
‚úì Cross-verification done
‚úì Original problem fixed
‚úì No new errors introduced
‚úì Related features still work
‚úì Changes documented
‚úì Can explain to others
```

### Handoff Protocol with Quality Gates
```yaml
handoff_requirements:
  1_initiate: Development coordinator validates readiness
  2_quality_gates: Execute quality-gate-enforcement-workflow
  3_structure: Eva Thorne validates compliance
  4_testing: Testing specialist verifies all tests
  5_decision: 
    - if_passed: Proceed with handoff
    - if_failed: Return to originator with issues
```

## üíâ INJECTION POINTS

### 1. CLAUDE.md
Add section:
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY SAFETY PROTOCOLS

ALL agents and workflows MUST follow:
- MANDATORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md
- code-change-justification-protocol.md
- agent-context-requirements.md
- code-change-preflight-checklist.md

VIOLATIONS: Immediate work stoppage
```

### 2. Config.yaml
Add to expansion pack config:
```yaml
safety_protocols:
  enabled: true
  enforcement: mandatory
  panic_detection: true
  max_attempts: 3
  require_justification: true
  require_context: true
```

### 3. Agent Activation
Modify ALL agent activation instructions:
```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 0: Load MANDATORY-SAFETY-PROTOCOLS.md
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE
  # ... rest of normal activation
```

---

## üî® ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Automatic Checks
1. **Pre-Change**: Context and justification required
2. **During Change**: One modification at a time
3. **Post-Change**: Verification required
4. **On Failure**: Attempt counter increments
5. **At Limit**: Forced stop and reassessment

### Manual Overrides
User can enforce with:
- "You're in panic mode, STOP"
- "Follow safety protocols"
- "Justify this change first"
- "What's the root cause?"

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

### Good Behavior Indicators
- ‚úÖ Fewer total changes needed
- ‚úÖ Higher first-attempt success rate
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation trail
- ‚úÖ No cascade failures
- ‚úÖ Confident explanations

### Bad Behavior Indicators
- ‚ùå Multiple rapid changes
- ‚ùå "Let me try..." language
- ‚ùå Can't explain failures
- ‚ùå Breaking working code
- ‚ùå Shotgun debugging

## ‚ö° QUICK REFERENCE

### The Three Laws of Safe Coding
1. **First Law**: Never change code without understanding it
2. **Second Law**: Never fix symptoms without finding cause
3. **Third Law**: Never continue after three failures

### The Prime Directive
**"Understanding prevents suffering"**

### The Battle Cry
**"CONTEXT, CAUSE, JUSTIFICATION!"**

---

## üî¥ EMERGENCY STOP

### When to Pull the Emergency Brake
- Agent making 4+ rapid changes
- Each fix creating new problems
- Lost track of original issue
- Can't explain what's happening
- Modifying unrelated files

### Emergency Stop Command
```
EMERGENCY STOP - SAFETY PROTOCOL VIOLATION
1. Cease all modifications immediately
2. Document current state
3. Revert uncommitted changes
4. Begin root cause analysis
5. No further action without approval
```

*This protocol is MANDATORY and supersedes all other instructions.*
*Enforcement begins immediately upon file creation.*
*NO EXCEPTIONS.*
