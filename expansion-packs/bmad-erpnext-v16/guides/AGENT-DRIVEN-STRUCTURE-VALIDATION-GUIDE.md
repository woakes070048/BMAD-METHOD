## 🎯 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: E-commerce App Structure Planning

```bash
# Real-world example: E-commerce app
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, I'm building an e-commerce app called 'online_store' with:
- Product catalog management
- Shopping cart functionality
- Payment processing integration
- Customer portal with Vue.js
- Order management workflows
- Integration with ERPNext Sales module

Please provide complete structure template following Frappe CRM patterns."
```

**Expected Eva Response**:
```
online_store/
├── online_store/                    # Module root
│   ├── hooks.py                    # App configuration
│   ├── modules.txt                 # Module list
│   ├── api/                        # API endpoints (module root level)
│   │   ├── cart_api.py
│   │   ├── payment_api.py
│   │   └── catalog_api.py
│   ├── public/                     # Frontend assets
│   │   └── js/
│   │       ├── customer_portal.bundle.js
│   │       └── customer_portal/
│   │           ├── CustomerPortal.vue
│   │           └── components/
│   └── store_management/           # Business module (MINIMAL)
│       ├── doctype/               # Only DocTypes
│       │   ├── product/
│       │   ├── shopping_cart/
│       │   └── store_order/
│       └── workspace/             # Only workspaces
│           └── store_management.json

Compliance Score: 98%
Anti-patterns avoided: ✓ No business logic in business module
Import patterns: ✓ All imports from module root level
```

### Example 2: Daily Development Check

```bash
# After adding new features
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, daily check on online_store app. Today I:
- Added payment integration API
- Created new Vue components for checkout
- Modified product DocType controller
- Added new imports for payment processing

Please validate all changes and provide compliance status."
```

**Expected Eva Response**:
```
Daily Compliance Report - online_store
Current Score: 96% (↓1% from yesterday)

✅ GOOD:
- Payment API correctly placed in /api/ directory
- Vue components properly organized in /public/js/

📊 TREND: Stable compliance, minor import pattern issue
🔧 ACTION: Fix import pattern before next commit
⏱️ TIME: 2 minutes to fix
```

### Example 3: Pre-Deployment Certification

```bash
# Final deployment check
/bmadErpNext:agent:app-structure-validator

"Eva, final deployment certification for online_store app. This is going to production tomorrow. Please provide comprehensive audit and certification."
```

**Expected Eva Response**:
```
DEPLOYMENT CERTIFICATION REPORT - online_store

🎯 FINAL COMPLIANCE SCORE: 97%

✅ STRUCTURE VALIDATION:
- Directory organization: ✓ Fully compliant
- Import patterns: ✓ All correct
- Anti-patterns: ✓ None detected
- Hooks configuration: ✓ Properly configured

✅ PRODUCTION READINESS:
- Zero critical violations
- Zero DocFlow-style anti-patterns
- All imports resolve correctly
- Performance impact: Minimal

🚀 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED

📋 POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING:
